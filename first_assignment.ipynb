    "(1)-Explain the key features  of Python that make it a popular choice for programming\n",
    " ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "1. Free and Open Source:\n",
    "  Python is open-source this means that source code is also available to the public. So you can download it use it as well as share it. \n",
    "2. Easy to code:\n",
    "  Python is  a developer-friendly language,because it has simple syntax so that it is easy to code in pyhton language.\n",
    "3. Python is a Portable language:\n",
    "  Python language is also a portable language. For example, if we have Python code for Windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it, we can run this code on any platform.\n",
    "4. Interpreted Language:\n",
    "  Python is an Interpreted Language because Python code is executed line by line at a time. like other languages C, C++, Java, etc. there is no need to compile Python code this makes it easier to debug our code. The source code of Python is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.\n",
    "5. Large Standard Library :\n",
    "  Python has a large standard library that provides a rich set of modules and functions so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in Python such as numpy, pandas,etc.\n",

    "(2)-Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "  Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and functions in the language. These keywords are used to define the structure and syntax of Python code. They cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names) because they are reserved for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    " Role of Predefined Keywords\n",
    " --------------------------------------\n",
    " 1. Defining Structures: Keywords are used to define the structure of code, such as loops, conditionals, functions.\n",
    " 2. Flow Control: Keywords control the flow of execution in a program, like if, else, while, for, and break.\n",
